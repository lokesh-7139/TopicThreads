# TopicThreads â€” Subject-wise Real-Time Discussion Platform

TopicThreads is a scalable, backend-powered discussion platform built to serve students, class representatives, and administrators of academic institutions. The platform facilitates real-time, structured discussions inside subject-based rooms, encouraging collaborative learning, doubt-solving, and organized communication between students and academic moderators.

# Core Idea

The core objective of TopicThreads is to simulate structured, topic-based discussions similar to modern platforms like Slack or Discord, but tailored specifically for educational institutes. Each subject acts like a discussion category, and within it, multiple rooms can be created to host Q&A sessions, exam prep discussions, announcements, etc.
